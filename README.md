# MazeWanderer
 A little game where you (a little circle) try to find your way out of a maze.
 
 When you first start the game, you will only see yourself (the circle) and a couple of lines around it. The rest of the maze is hidden, as you navigate through the maze, you will discover more and more of the maze.
Use the left, right, up, and down arrows to navigate your way through the maze.
Your goal is to find the "X" in the maze. When you do, you win.
